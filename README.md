# Object-Oriented-Programming-Java
Welcome to the Java Assessments & Data Structures repository! This project is designed to help developers, students, and interviewees practice Java-related coding problems, with a special focus on data structures and algorithm-based questions. Whether you're preparing for coding interviews, working on your programming skills, or studying for exams, this repository offers a variety of problems, assessments, and solutions for your learning journey.

Overview
This repository is a collection of Java coding assessments focused on core programming concepts, problem-solving skills, and mastery of data structures. Each assessment covers common patterns found in technical interviews and computer science exams. The questions are organized by topic and difficulty level, ranging from beginner to advanced.

The repository contains:

Java-based algorithms and data structures: Solutions to common problems involving arrays, linked lists, trees, hash maps, etc.
Interview questions: Real-world Java questions frequently asked in coding interviews.
Test cases: Each solution is accompanied by test cases for easy validation of the code.
Documentation: Clear explanations for each problem, solution, and approach.
Features
Multiple topics: Problems covering algorithms, data structures, object-oriented programming, and more.
Structured assessments: Practice sets categorized by difficulty level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced).
In-depth solutions: Each problem is solved with well-documented code and explanations of the logic.
Automated testing: JUnit test cases are included to validate the correctness of solutions.
Updated regularly: New questions and challenges will be added frequently to ensure you stay up-to-date.
Technologies
This repository uses the following technologies:

Java 17: The programming language used for solving all assessments.
JUnit: Testing framework used to write unit tests for the solutions.
Maven: Build automation tool used for managing dependencies and running test cases.
Data Structures Covered
We provide Java-based problems on a wide range of data structures, including but not limited to:

Arrays
Strings
Linked Lists
Stacks
Queues
Hash Maps / Hash Tables
Trees (Binary Trees, BST, etc.)
Graphs
Heaps and Priority Queues
Tries
Sorting and Searching Algorithms
Each data structure comes with a set of coding problems, solutions, and discussions on the most efficient approaches (time and space complexity analysis).

How to Use
To get started with the assessments, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/java-assessments-data-structures.git
Navigate into the project folder:

bash
Copy code
cd java-assessments-data-structures
Build the project (requires Maven):

bash
Copy code
mvn clean install
Run the tests:

bash
Copy code
mvn test
Explore the problems: You can find Java files for each problem in the /src/main/java directory, and corresponding test cases in /src/test/java.

Each folder inside the repository corresponds to a different data structure or algorithmic problem, with the problem descriptions and solutions inside.
